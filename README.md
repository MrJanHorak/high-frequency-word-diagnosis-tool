# High Frequency Word Diagnosis Tool

### A quick summary of why I am working on this tool:

My wife is a 2nd grade teacher in a public school. She has several students who have some difficulty reading. This problem has been amplified considering when these students were in Kindergarten, the pandemic hit and schools went to learning from home. Several of her students may not have had the opportunity to make use of online tools to keep up with learning. Now in second grade, this has become the first year they are fully back in school. Standards expect students to be at 2nd grade level, realistically educationally many of the students are still in Kindergarten. Not to thier fault or the fault of the schools. 

To help teachers (or in this case at least specifically one specific one) better track students and help students close the 'COVID-Learning-Gap' this App is being created.
